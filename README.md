# 🛡️ Real-Time Network Intrusion Detection System Dashboard

A real-time Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) built using **Snort 3, Scapy, SQLite, and Streamlit**.

The system captures live network traffic, detects suspicious activity using Snort signature-based detection, stores packet and alert data in SQLite, and visualizes network activity through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

The project also includes a **preprocessed Snort rule documentation dataset**, enriched alert JSON generation, and a custom multi-attack PCAP replay workflow for repeatable IDS testing and future LLM/RAG-based alert explanation.

## PCAP Replay and Live Detection Flow

A custom multi-attack PCAP was created for repeatable IDS testing. The actual PCAP file is **not included in this repository** because of its large size. The replay process, commands, and results are documented instead.

        │
        ▼

        │
        ▼
Streamlit Dashboard
```

In parallel, `live_packet_collector.py` captures packet metadata from `enp0s8` and stores it in the `packets` table.

Simple flow:

```text
PCAP replay → Snort rule matching → alert_json.txt → alerts table → enriched JSON → dashboard
```

---

## Remote Dashboard Access

The Streamlit dashboard runs inside the Ubuntu Snort/Dashboard VM.

For private lab access, the dashboard can be exposed through the Windows host machine using VirtualBox NAT forwarding and Windows portproxy.

Current working access structure:

```text
Client Device / Mentor System
        │
        ▼
Windows Host IP:8501
        │
        ▼
Windows portproxy
        │
        ▼
127.0.0.1:8501
        │
        ▼
VirtualBox NAT Port Forwarding
        │
        ▼
Ubuntu VM Streamlit Dashboard
```

The dashboard is **hosted inside the Ubuntu VM**. The Windows host acts as a gateway/forwarding layer to make the dashboard accessible to other reachable systems.

Example URL:

```text
http://<windows-host-ip>:8501
```

The dashboard is accessible only while:

- Windows host is powered on
- Ubuntu VM is running
- Streamlit dashboard is running
- VirtualBox NAT forwarding is active
- Windows portproxy rule is active

Previously captured data can still be viewed from SQLite even if live attacks are not running, but the VM and Streamlit dashboard must still be online.

```

---

## Custom Multi-Attack PCAP Testing

A custom PCAP was generated because many public IDS datasets were too large for the lab setup.

The custom PCAP includes traffic from:

- Gobuster directory enumeration
- Nikto vulnerability scanning
- DVWA attacks
- sqlmap SQL injection testing
- XSS payloads
- File inclusion and path traversal attempts
- Command injection payloads
- Brute-force login attempts
- curl and manual HTTP traffic

### PCAP File

```text
multi_attack_demo_mtu1500.pcap
```

The PCAP file is **not committed to this repository** because of file size. The replay process and measured results are documented for reproducibility.

### PCAP Replay Results

| Metric | Value | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| Packets Replayed | 135,292 | Packets successfully sent by tcpreplay from the PCAP |
| Replay Speed | 800 pps | Configured tcpreplay sending rate |
| Replay Duration | 169.11 seconds | Time taken to replay the PCAP once |
| Replay Data Size | 37.46 MB | Total replayed payload/data size reported by tcpreplay |
| Raw Alerts Generated | 807 | Snort JSON alerts counted from `alert_json.txt` in the final dashboard test |
| Alert Percentage | 0.60% | Raw alerts divided by replayed packets |
| Packets per Alert | 167.6 | Average replayed packets per generated Snort alert |
| DB Alerts Stored | 802 | Alert records currently stored in `ids_live.db` |
| Packet Rows Captured | 1,707 | Packet rows inserted by `live_packet_collector.py`; not the same as packets replayed |

Earlier clean measurement produced 786 raw alerts. The final dashboard screenshot shows 807 raw alerts because additional alerts were generated after the first clean replay. The README reports the final dashboard state.

### Replay Command

Run this from the Kali VM:

```bash
sudo tcpreplay -i eth1 --loop=1 --pps=800 ~/nids-pcaps/scanner-test/clean/multi_attack_demo_mtu1500.pcap
```

Packets are not equal to alerts. Most packets are TCP handshakes, ACKs, responses, and normal traffic. Snort only generates alerts when traffic matches an enabled rule.

---

## Top Alerts Observed

| Alert Signature | Count | Explanation |
|---|---:|---|
| `SERVER-WEBAPP Compaq Insight directory traversal` | 320 | Directory traversal style web request; likely caused by web scanning probes |
| `SERVER-WEBAPP iChat directory traversal attempt` | 215 | Directory traversal attempt against a known legacy web path |
| `OS-MOBILE Apple iPhone User-Agent detected` | 50 | Mobile User-Agent string detected during scanner/random-agent traffic |
| `OS-MOBILE Android User-Agent detected` | 33 | Android User-Agent string detected during scanner/random-agent traffic |
| `SERVER-WEBAPP remote include path attempt` | 15 | Possible remote file inclusion or suspicious web parameter attempt |

These alerts came mainly from web scanning, directory traversal attempts, User-Agent variation, DVWA-style attacks, and suspicious web payloads.

---

## Enriched Alert JSON Export

The enriched alert JSON is generated by joining:

```text
ids_live.db alerts table
+
data/json/rule_docs_preprocessed_by_sid.json
```

The output file is:

```text
data/json/enriched_snort_alerts_with_rule_docs.json
```

Run:

```bash
cd /home/maheen/ids_streamlit_dashboard
python3 scripts/export_enriched_alerts_json.py
```

This file contains selected alert fields with matching rule documentation. It is a latest snapshot, not permanent full alert history.

If the dashboard shows:

```text
This selected alert was not found in the enriched JSON file.
```

run the export script again to refresh the combined JSON.

---

## Database Management

The system uses a rolling-window storage strategy.

### Packets

- Captured using Scapy
- Stored in SQLite
- Latest 5,000 packets retained

### Alerts

- Generated by Snort
- Parsed from Snort JSON alert logs
- Stored in SQLite
- Latest 10,000 alerts retained

This prevents unlimited database growth while preserving recent monitoring information for the dashboard.

Raw Snort alerts are also saved separately in:

```text
/home/maheen/snort_logs/alert_json.txt
```

---

## Snort Log Rotation

Snort alert logs can be managed using `logrotate`.

Recommended behavior:

- Rotate after 5 MB
- Keep the latest 5 rotated logs
- Compress old logs automatically
- Continue logging without restarting Snort

Example log files:

```text
alert_json.txt
alert_json.txt.1
alert_json.txt.2.gz
alert_json.txt.3.gz
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard not updating

Ensure:

- Packet collector is running
- Alert collector is running
- Snort is running
- Streamlit dashboard is running
- Browser/dashboard refresh is enabled

### No packets captured

Check:

- Correct interface is configured
- Host-only adapter is connected
- Kali, victim, and Snort VM are on the same network
- Scapy collector is running with `sudo`

### No Snort alerts

Check:

- Snort community rules are loaded
- Snort is monitoring the correct interface
- Traffic matches enabled Snort signatures
- Alert collector is reading the correct JSON alert log

### Selected alert not found in enriched JSON

Run:

```bash
cd /home/maheen/ids_streamlit_dashboard
python3 scripts/export_enriched_alerts_json.py
```

Then refresh the dashboard.

### Kali cannot reach victim

Check Kali IP and route:

```bash
ip -br addr
ip route
```

Expected Kali host-only IP:

```text
192.168.56.10/24
```

Test victim connectivity:

```bash
ping -c 4 192.168.56.20
```

### SQLite database growing too large

The project automatically limits:

```text
Packets → Latest 5,000

Snort logs are managed separately using log rotation.

### Dashboard accessible locally but not from other systems

Check:

- Windows host IP
- Windows firewall rule
- VirtualBox NAT port forwarding
- Windows portproxy rule
- Whether the other system can route to the Windows host IP

### DNS not working inside Ubuntu VM

If `ping 8.8.8.8` works but `ping google.com` fails, DNS is the issue.

```bash
sudo rm -f /etc/resolv.conf
echo -e "nameserver 8.8.8.8\nnameserver 1.1.1.1" | sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf
```

## Files Not Committed

The following runtime or large files are intentionally not committed:

```text
ids_live.db
alert_json.txt
multi_attack_demo_mtu1500.pcap
__pycache__/
*.log
```

Reason:

- `ids_live.db` is runtime database output
- `alert_json.txt` is generated Snort alert output
- `multi_attack_demo_mtu1500.pcap` is large test traffic data
- Logs and cache files are generated during execution

---

## Future Improvements

- LLM/RAG-based Snort alert explanation
- Automated rule context retrieval from the JSON dataset
- Alert notifications for high-priority events
- Multi-sensor monitoring
- Better packet-to-alert correlation
- PostgreSQL or Elasticsearch backend
- Historical trend analysis
- Authentication for shared dashboard access
- Deployment on a dedicated lab-accessible server
